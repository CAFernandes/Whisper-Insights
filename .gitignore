# pyenv
#   For a library or application, you probably want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms. In such cases, it may be better
#   to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by PDM, Flit and potentially other build tools.
